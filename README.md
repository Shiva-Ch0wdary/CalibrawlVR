# CalibrawlVR: Projectile Motion and Gravity

This project introduces an innovative approach to physics education through immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environments. Designed to make complex physics concepts such as projectile motion and gravity more accessible and engaging, the project provides an interactive and immersive learning experience. 

## Features

- **Interactive Learning Environments**:
  - **Projectile Motion Module**: Three progressive levels focusing on:
    - Adjusting launch angles and observing trajectories.
    - Complex scenarios with moving targets and multiple parameters.
    - Advanced simulations incorporating air drag.
  - **Gravity Module**: Two levels emphasizing:
    - Gravitational force between objects.
    - Consistent acceleration of freely falling objects regardless of mass.
- **Hands-Free Interaction**: Intuitive controls allow users to interact with simulations without traditional hand controllers.
- **Engaging Visuals**: Real-world scenarios and physics simulations for enhanced learning.

## Technology Stack

- **VR Development**: Unity 3D, Oculus SDK.
- **Physics Engine**: Realistic simulations of projectile motion and gravity.
- **Interaction Design**: Hands-free controls for intuitive gameplay.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- VR Headset: Compatible with Oculus devices.
- Unity 3D: For running or modifying the project.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
